Aaron Hamid (1):
* wrap two scopes in procs to fix migration/startup issues

Andre Duffeck (1):
* fix values_for

Ivan Buiko (1):
* Adding retrieval by exact value

Sebastian Borrazas (1):
* Not raising exception when the bitmask column is not found, since its adding it on a migration

spemmons (22):
* detect whether or not nulls are possible with an attribute and remove OR conditions checking if it is null or not
* check for model not being ready when creating scopes
* support nulls with an explicit attribute, not by inspecting the model due to preloading issues
* support multiple values in the "without_..." scope that excludes match for of any of the bits; previously 2nd and following values were ignored
* DRY-up scope expressions, standardizing on "no_" and "bitmask_for_...(*values)" instead of repeating more complex calculations; also found another example of zykadelic's complaint with "with_any_" that is fixed and has tests
* add travis configuration file
* add :zero_value option and tests
* rename :zero to :zero_value for clarity
